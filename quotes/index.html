		<h1>Quotes</h1>
		<blockquote>
			<p>It's in Apple's DNA that technology alone is not enough. That it's technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the result that makes our heart sing.</p>
			<footer>Steve Jobs at Apple Special Event, March 2011</footer>

		<blockquote>
			<p>We don&#39;t read and write poetry because it&#39;s cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for. To quote from Whitman, &quot;O me! O life!... of the questions of these recurring; of the endless trains of the faithless... of cities filled with the foolish; what good amid these, O me, O life?&quot; Answer. That you are here - that life exists, and identity; that the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. That the powerful play <i>goes on</i> and you may contribute a verse. What will your verse be?</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Once you start to examine the question, it's surprising how much different fields' ideas of beauty have in common. The same principles of good design crop up again and again.</p>
			<footer>Paul Graham, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/taste.html"><i>Taste for Makers</i></a></footer>

		<blockquote>
			<p>The hacker mind-set is not confined to this software-hacker culture. There are people who apply the hacker attitude to other things, like electronics or music â€” actually, you can find it at the highest levels of any science or art.</p>
			<p>Work as intensely as you play and play as intensely as you work. For true hackers, the boundaries between "play", "work", "science" and "art" all tend to disappear, or to merge into a high-level creative playfulness.</p>
